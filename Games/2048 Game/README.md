# 2048 Game

Can be played [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/Games/2048%20Game/index.html).

## Gameplay

Tiles slide in the direction the player chooses, and identical tiles combine by summing their values. New tiles spawn randomly, so the player must plan strategically to avoid losing by filling up the board and running out of moves.

The original game is won upon constructing the **2048** tile.

## Controls
