Hexagonal 2048
Yet another hexagonal variant of Gabriele Cirulli's 2048. This project was started in summer 2017, inspired by a love for the original and an introductory course to using p5.js for game design, and has become a project for learning the secrets of JavaScript and practising good design.

Hexagonal 2048 can be played here.

Gameplay
Tiles slide in the direction the player chooses, and identical tiles combine by summing their values. New tiles spawn randomly, so the player must plan strategically to avoid losing by filling up the board and running out of moves.

The original game is won upon constructing the 2048 tile, but with the added degrees of freedom in Hexagonal 2048, getting there is barely a challenge. It has not yet been decided which tile presents the equivalent challenge in Hexagonal 2048, so there is presently no win condition.

Controls
Swiping and click-dragging work on all devices. Alternatively, use the following keyboard commands to move in the respective directions:

    W
Q       E

A       D
    S
By using p5.js, the entire game exists within a canvas for the easiest image capture. Simply right click the canvas and Copy Image or Save Image to capture the board.

Credit
The colour scheme, scoring algorithm, and gameplay are all modelled after Gabriele Cirulli's 2048.

By no means is this a novel variant of 2048, nor does it carry a unique name. This was developed independently of similar games (some better, some worse) which may be easily found by Googling "Hexagonal 2048".
